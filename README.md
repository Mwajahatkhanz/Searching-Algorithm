# Searching Algorithms: Binary Search and Linear Search

## *Purpose of the Code*
This project demonstrates the implementation of *Binary Search* and *Linear Search*. It is designed to help students understand core searching algorithms, their functionality, and efficiency.

## *How to Run the Program*
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mwajahatkhanz/Searching-Algorithm
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Searching-Algorithm
   ```
   
4. Open the program file in your preferred IDE or run it directly via terminal using Python:
   ```bash
   python search_algorithms.py
   ```
   
5. Input a sorted array and the element you want to search when prompted.

## *Time Complexity*
### *Binary Search:*
- *Best Case:* O(1) (When the middle element is the target)
- *Worst Case:* O(log(n))
- *Print Example:* In a worst-case scenario, Binary Search will search in n divisions of the array.

### *Linear Search:*
- *Best Case:* O(1) (When the first element is the target)
- *Worst Case:* O(n)

## *Repository Highlights*
- *Clean Code:* Well-structured and commented code for better understanding.
- *Documentation:* Includes this README file explaining the project in detail.
- *Efficiency:* Shows the practical time complexity of each algorithm.
